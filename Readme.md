# Inbound Implementation

This document outlines the steps needed to complete the implementation of the Inbound functionality in the 3PL Door App.

## Files Implemented

1. **InboundScreen.tsx** - The main screen that lists all scheduled inbounds and allows navigation to process a specific inbound.
2. **InboundDetailScreen.tsx** - The screen that handles the step-by-step process of receiving a scheduled inbound.
3. **UnknownInboundScreen.tsx** - The screen that handles receiving an unscheduled (unknown) inbound.
4. **inboundService.ts** - API service file that contains all the API calls needed for the inbound functionalities.

## Required Dependencies

Before running the app, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install expo-image-picker
# or
yarn add expo-image-picker
```

## Navigation Updates

The following updates have been made to the navigation system:

1. Added `InboundDetail` to the `RootStackParamList` in `navigation/types.ts`
2. Added the route definition in `AppNavigator.tsx`
3. Updated the navigation in `InboundScreen.tsx` to navigate to the detail screen

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install the required dependencies listed above.

2. **Image Handling**: The current implementation uses placeholders for image capture. To fully implement this feature:
   - Integrate with `expo-image-picker` for capturing photos
   - Implement proper image upload logic to send photos to the server

3. **Testing with Real API**: Test all API integrations with your backend:
   - Retrieving inbounds
   - Submitting inbound processing
   - Handling MRN errors
   - Processing unknown inbounds

4. **UI Polish**:
   - Add loading indicators for API calls
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Add sound notifications for successful scans (similar to the original Vue app)

5. **Offline Support**:
   - Implement caching logic for inbound data
   - Add offline queue for operations performed without internet connection

## Important API Endpoints Used

- `/warehouse/systems/door/inbounds` (GET) - Get list of scheduled inbounds
- `/warehouse/systems/door/inbounds` (POST) - Submit inbound processing
- `/warehouse/systems/door/unknown-inbound` (POST) - Submit unknown inbound
- `/warehouse/systems/door/check-goods-in-lane-exists` - Validate receipt lane
- `/warehouse/systems/door/inbounds/grn/set-arrived` - Update GRN arrival status
- `/warehouse/systems/door/inbounds/mrn-error` - Handle MRN errors
- `/utilities/companies` - Get company information

## Notes

- The current implementation has been adapted from the old Vue application while applying modern React Native patterns.
- For photo capture, the app needs camera permissions, which are requested at runtime.
- The styling has been modernized using the app's theme system.
- Error handling has been improved to provide better user feedback.
